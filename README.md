# troubleshoot-ftl

I have moved fasterthanli.me somewhere else. You've told me it's down, but
my status page, <https://status.fasterthanli.me>, disagrees.

I'm willing to believe you, since I'm using a bunch of cheap service providers.

So, what broke? Let's run some quick diagnostics.

## Running diagnostics

Clone this repository, then run `./troubleshoot-ftl.sh`

Then, post the results to <https://gist.github.com> and send me the resulting
gist on whichever platform you reached out to me. Thanks!
